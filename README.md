# Four-Body Contributions to $\bar{B} \to X_{s}\gamma$ at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s})$

This Repository contains the rules and expressions that are necessary to construct the remaining four body contributions to the matrix $G^{(1)}_{ij}$.
These are the ones that are not already contained in the result of https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7677, i.e. the ones that require FiveBody Gluon Bremsstrahlung Diagrams for IR cancellations.

A definition of the matrix $G_{ij}$ can be found in eq. (3.5) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7677. 
The rate of the physical process can be directly related to the matrix, as the entry 

The result found here is split up into two parts: insertion I and insertion II, which represent the different insertions of the operators.
Insertion I is built from the diagrams where there are two different fermion lines and insertion II from those with only one.
